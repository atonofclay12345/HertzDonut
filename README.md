Sound to light: a fun project that will take in the frequency of a sound and output the speed of light divided by the frequency which will correlate to a color wavelength for reactive LED's.

###Usage

```
pip install pyaudio numpy matplotlib struct time

python audio_test.py

```

###Plan

```
We are going to start with getting audio input from the computer.
Then we will get frequency and decibal values from the stream.
From there we will correlate decibal levels with brightness of LEDs.
The frequency will be split into a five or six color range, that
will be transmitted to the LED strip. 

```

###TODO

```
* Start writing .ino code

* Get power source/hardware hooked up for more lights
